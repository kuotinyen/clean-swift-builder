# Clean Swift Builder
a clean swift xcode template inspired by my friend Ni.

# How to use
First, download the xcode template folder in the repository.

Second, open terminal and run `cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Source`.
(If you are not using `Xcode.app` as your app name, just update to fit yours.)

Last, drag the xcode template folder into `Source` folder, and all is done.

# Edit Xcode template
You can not edit xcode template files after the template is dragged into that `Source` folder, if you'd like to edit the xcode template, please edit it outside and re-drag it.
